# Homework-05
This was my fifth weekly Homework
I have built everything from scratch by using what we have covered in the class.

this is a simple work day scheduler that user can save events or duties to be done.
as user open the page can see the day of the week and the work day hours with different colors.
if it is green it means its the upcoming hour.
it it is red it means its the current hour.
if it is dark it means its the past hour.

it is usable for differen screen sizes.
